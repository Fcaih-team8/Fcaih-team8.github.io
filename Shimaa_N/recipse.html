<h2>1.Middle Eastern Kibbeh </h2>
<h6>
  Cook Time:2hour
</h6>
  <p>These traditional patties are made with ground lamb, cooked bulgur wheat, chopped mint, and onions. "Kibbeh is a wonderful dish from the Middle East traditionally made with lamb meat but beef is acceptable, too," says Ron Shepherd. "I prefer it made into patties and fried in olive oil. However, it is most often found in restaurants in baked form. Serve kibbeh with tahini, a sesame seed paste."

 <h2>2.Syrian Chicken Shawarma </h2>
  <h6>Cook Time: 1 hour & 30 minutes </h6>
