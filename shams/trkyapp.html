                <h2>Kebap</h2>
                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Sis-kebab-1.jpg.webp" alt="recipe img" class="Photo">
                <p>The most popular minced meat kebabs are Adana kebabı, spiced minced beef squished onto skewers and cooked over a fire, and Urfa kebabı, a less spicy version. 

                    Şiş, or shish, kebab is succulent, perfectly square cuts of lamb or chicken grilled on skewers. Or have it wrapped in bread and served in a plastic sleeve to catch the dripping fat. The left over bits, the çöp or rubbish, from making those square lamb chunks are mashed together with garlic and tomato, laced onto skewers, and grilled to make the juicy and so so delicious çöp şiş kebabı. Mouth watering.

                <h2>Köfte</h2>
                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Kofte-640x427.jpg.webp" alt="recipe img" class="Photo">
                <p>Meat balls. Don’t go into a köfte restaurant expecting anything other than köfte. These restaurants are heaven for the indecisive. The only choices here are whether you have a full or half portion and whether you fancy
                     green salad or piyaz – beans and onions in oil. And don’t expect balls, either.
                     Köfte is spiced minced beef formed into rolls and fried. To complete the experience, make sure there’s a pot of hot red pepper sauce on the table; it perfectly tangs up the succulent meat.</p>

                <h2>Hamsi (anchovy)</h2>
                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Hamsi-.jpg.webp" alt="recipe img">
                <p>With around 5,000 miles of coastline, fishing is big industry. But the number one favorite fish is hamsi, fresh from the Black Sea. While it can be baked or poached, it’s simply best when it is fried. This intense flavored little fish is cooked whole, coated in a little flour, and placed in a wheel formation around the frying pan. Once the first side is cooked, place a plate over the top, flip the pan, and slide the wheel of fish back in to cook on the other side. Delicious served with a green salad.  </p>

                <h2>Zeytinyağlılar (“those with olive oil”)</h2>
                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Zeytinyaglilar-.jpg.webp" alt="recipe img" class="Photo">
                <p>Time to feed the vegans. Any restaurant displaying a variety of dishes in the window will also have zeytinyağlılar – vegetable dishes cooked in olive oil and served cold. The most popular dishes are leek, runner bean, and artichoke, but you can also find eggplant, celeriac, and red and green peppers. Onions and carrots are sautéd in olive oil to form a base to which a single vegetable, not a mix of vegetables, and water is added together with a little rice and lemon juice.
                    Light and refreshing, they make a great starter or a meal when put them together with bulgur rice. You’ll find them also on the meze menu, but more about mezes later.

                <h2>Karnıyarık</h2>
                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Karniyarik.jpg.webp" alt="recipe img" class="Photo">
                <p>As with so much of Turkish cuisine there is a meat version and a veggie version. Karnıyarık is the meat version of İmam bayıldı, cooked exactly the same but with ground beef or lamb in the stuffing. It’s never going to look elegant on the plate but it is a delicious dish, and best served with rice and plain yoghurt.
