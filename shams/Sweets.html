                <p>The künefe is a sort of cake that is traditionally eaten in kebab restaurants. It is usually not found in pastries, because it must be eaten hot. Originally from the south of Turkey, it is made from angel hair, a Turkish cheese called dil peynir (local version of mozzarella) butter, and sugar syrup. We strongly recommend you to taste one with warm Turkish tea.</p>

                <h2>baklava</h2>

                <p>The baklava can be compared to “mille–feuille” of phyllo dough (yufka). In Turkey, it is traditionally prepared by stuffing pistachios, nuts, or more rarely almonds or hazelnuts between layers of yufka leaves. The city of Gaziantep in southeastern Turkey is famous for its baklava with pistachios and considers itself as the birthplace of this dish.

                    Although it can be found everywhere, it is very hard to do well and must be eaten fresh out of the oven.</p>

                <p>This is one of the most popular desserts in Turkey. It is very original because it is a kind of pudding made from chicken breast, rice, milk, sugar, and cinnamon. “Tavuk göğsü” means “chicken breast”.</p>
